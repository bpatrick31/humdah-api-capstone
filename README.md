Thinkful (https://www.thinkful.com/) API Capstone Project analyzing HMDA Data

Link to the live demo: https://bpatrick31.github.io/humdah-api-capstone/index.html

## Summary:

The HMDA, aka "HUMDAH" requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose loan-level information about mortgages. Use our analyzer to gain deep insights and mortgage trends in your state.

This application will allow you to select the state of your choice, and then we will analyze the number of loans that were originated or denied from 2012 - 2017. Draw upon these insights to see trends on loan processing volume in your state.

## How to use it
Once you are on the insights page (shown in the second screenshot) select the state you'd like to analyze. We will send that request to the CFPB and then summarize the information based on the filters you select. You can filter for different insights by analyzing specific years or the type of loan like (home purchase, a refefinance, or a loan for improvements). Hit update and you will have your returned values! On the chart information below, you can filter for the specific loan types by clicking on the legend. Give it a try!

## Technology Used:
1) Languages: (HTML, CSS, JS, Jquery)
      
2) API's & Datachar Library
    HMDA Database (CFPB) API: http://cfpb.github.io/api/hmda/index.html
    Highcharts: https://www.highcharts.com/demo/areaspline
    

## Future Dev Ideas
1) Add in additional insights on the loan denial reason
2) Allow the user to drill down to the county level of the loan processing data
3) Add in an geomap of the united states showing the states that have the most growth available
