Summary:

The HMDA, aka "HUMDAH" requires many financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose loan-level information about mortgages. Use our analyzer to gain deep insights and mortgage trends in your state.

This application will allow you to select the state of your choice, and then we will analyze the number of loans that were originated or denied from 2012 - 2017. Draw upon these insights to see trends on loan processing volume in your state.
